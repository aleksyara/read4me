      name: `'I presume such a thing should be possible. It seems reasonable.
      How would one predict the fundamental frequency or various frequencies/modes of vibration from an equation of motion like (1)? Then let's say I can calculate a given fundamental frequency of 𝑓. How would I then go about establishing the damping coefficient that would most rapidly extinguish it?
